NAME
	xpybar - A highly extensible minimalistic dock panel configured in Python 3

SYNOPSIS
	xpybar [OPTION]... [-- CONFIGURATION_OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
	xpybar is a minimalistic dock panel with high extensibility.
	Its source code is designed so that all parts of it can
	be replaced by a configuration script. This is one of the
	reasons xpybar is written in Python.

	xpybar itself is very small, but it comes with a large array
	of extensions (installed to </usr/share/xpybar/plugins>). The
	extensions come with associated configuration script examples
	(installed to </usr/share/xpybar/examples/plugins>.) There are
	some additional examples in </usr/share/xpybar/examples>.

	The configuration script must be written in Python 3,
	it will be loaded as part of the xpybar's source code itself.
	CONFIGURATION_OPTION will be available to the configuration
	script via the variable config_file, which is a list.

OPTIONS
	-c
	--configurations FILE
		Select configuration script. If not used, the program
		will search for a file named xpybarrc or .xpybarrc
		(depending on the directory) in the usual configuration
		directories.

	-h
	-?
	--help
		Print this help information.

	-v
	--version
		Print program name and version.

	-C
	--copying
	--copyright
		Print copyright information.

	-W
	--warranty
		Print non-warranty information.

RATIONALE
	There are a lot of panel projects, too many for me to
	have tried all of them. xpybar is intended to replace
	dzen2, xmobar, and eventually mate-panel, for me, with
	one single panel. This makes it ease to pack data into
	a much smaller space. xpybar is also designed to be
	easier to extend and customise than xmobar, in a language
	understood by more users.
