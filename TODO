         This (read-only) file contains three numbers: the number of allocated
         file handles (i.e., the number of files presently opened); the number
         of free file handles; and the maximum number of file handles (i.e.,
         the same value as /proc/sys/fs/file-max). If the number of allocated
         file handles is close to the maximum, you should consider increasing
         the maximum. Before Linux 2.6, the kernel allocated file handles
         dynamically, but it didn't free them again. Instead the free file
         handles were kept in a list for reallocation; the "free file handles"
         value indicates the size of that list. A large number of free file
         handles indicates that there was a past peak in the usage of open
         file handles. Since Linux 2.6, the kernel does deallocate freed file
         handles, and the "free file handles" value is always zero.
